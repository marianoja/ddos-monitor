# Global DDoS Attack Monitor

This project is an interactive web application that monitors and visualizes Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks globally. It leverages technologies such as D3.js and TopoJSON to represent the attack routes on a world map in real-time, highlighting the source and target locations.

## Features

- **World Map Visualization**: Displays an interactive map with the routes of DDoS attacks.
- **Real-Time Attack Simulation**: Simulates DDoS attacks between random countries with visual indicators on the map.
- **Attack Counter**: Keeps a running tally of the total number of attacks.
- **Top 10 Attacked Countries**: Shows a list of the top 10 most attacked countries.

## Technologies Used

- **D3.js**: For creating dynamic and interactive data visualizations.
- **TopoJSON**: For handling the world map data.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: The core structure and styling of the application.
